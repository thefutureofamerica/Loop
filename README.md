Naterade is my artificial pancreas. It is a stone resting on the boulders of work done by [@bewest](https://github.com/bewest/decoding-carelink), [@ps2](https://github.com/ps2/rileylink) and many others.

Please understand that this project:
- Is highly experimental
- Is not approved for therapy

### LoopKit

Naterade is built on top of [LoopKit](https://github.com/loudnate/LoopKit). LoopKit is a set of frameworks that provide data storage, retrieval, and calcluation, as well as boilerplate view controllers.

## Can I run Naterade?

Unless your name is Nate, that might be weird for you. Instead, I'd encourage you to look at [Loop](https://github.com/loudnate/Loop), which is nearly identical to Naterade but it has some additional benefits, like:

* Setup and customization instructions
* Stable, [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)-based release process
